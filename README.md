# cucount: CUDA-Powered Pair Counts

**cucount** is a high-performance CUDA implementation for computing pair counts (positions - spins), optimized for GPUs. It provides both NumPy and JAX interfaces depending on your workflow.

> ⚠️ A CUDA-capable GPU is required.

---

## 📦 Installation

You can install `cucount` directly via pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/adematti/cucount.git
```

The JAX API (through FFI) will be built automatically if the `jax.ffi` library is found during installation.

---

## 🧮 NumPy API

Use the NumPy API if you're not using JAX. All data stays on the **host (CPU)** and is internally transferred to the GPU.

### Example

```python
import numpy as np
from cucount.numpy import count2, Particles, BinAttrs

# Prepare catalogs
size = int(1e6)
boxsize = np.array((3000.,) * 3)
rng = np.random.RandomState(seed=42)

def generate_catalog(rng, size):
    offset = boxsize
    positions = rng.uniform(0., 1., (size, 3)) * boxsize + offset
    weights = rng.uniform(0., 1., size)
    return positions, weights

positions1, weights1 = generate_catalog(rng, size)
positions2, weights2 = generate_catalog(rng, size)

# Define binning and line-of-sight
edges = (np.linspace(1., 201, 201), np.linspace(-1., 1., 201))
los = 'midpoint'

# Compute pair counts, with 4 threads (i.e. on 4 GPU)
# If you want to go multi-node, MPI is a good option
particles1 = Particles(positions1, weights1)
particles2 = Particles(positions2, weights2)
battrs = BinAttrs(s=edges[0], mu=(edges[1], los))
counts = count2(particles1, particles2, battrs=battrs, nthreads=4)
# counts is a dictionary with key "weight"
```

For angular measurements on the sky, you can also request `phi` bins in addition to `theta` with
`BinAttrs(theta=theta_edges, phi=phi_edges)`. In the current implementation, `phi` is defined relative
to the phase of the first catalog spin field, so catalog 1 must provide `spin_values` and a non-zero
`WeightAttrs(spin=(s1, s2))` with `s1 != 0`.

## ⚡ JAX API

Use the JAX interface if JAX is already part of your codebase.

### Why a separate JAX API?

1. **JAX preallocates GPU memory**, which can cause `cudaMalloc` to fail if using the NumPy backend.
2. **Passing device arrays** (from JAX) directly avoids host-device transfers.
3. **JAX's distributed capabilities** (e.g., `shard_map`) are well-suited for scaling.

### 🚀 Single-Device JAX Example

```python
import jax
from jax import config
config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)  # Currently only double precision is supported

from cucount.jax import count2, Particles, BinAttrs

# Assume positions1, positions2, weights1, weights2 are already defined
edges = (np.linspace(1., 201, 201), np.linspace(-1., 1., 201))
los = 'midpoint'
battrs = BinAttrs(s=edges[0], mu=(edges[1], los))

particles1 = Particles(positions1, weights1)
particles2 = Particles(positions2, weights2)

counts = count2(particles1, particles2, battrs=battrs)
# counts is a dictionary with key "weight"
```

---

### 🧩 Multi-Device (Distributed) JAX Example

Using [shard\_map](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/shard_map.html), you can parallelize over multiple devices:

```python
import jax
jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)
# Initialize distributed environment (if needed)
jax.distributed.initialize()
from cucount.jax import count2, Particles, BinAttrs, create_sharding_mesh

battrs = BinAttrs(s=edges[0], mu=(edges[1], los))

# Run distributed pair counts
with create_sharding_mesh():
    # Pass exchange=True if input is distributed over multiple processes
    particles1 = Particles(positions1, weights1)
    particles2 = Particles(positions2, weights2)
    counts = count2(particles1, particles2, battrs=battrs)
```
